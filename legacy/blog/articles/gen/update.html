				<p id="articleText">This website may not seem like much now, but I'm going to build it. If it looks like progress is slow, I'm either working on some hidden backend stuff(Next thing is wrapping text around images better), or just not working on it at all.</p>

				<p id="articleText">Wrapping text around images is being tested with this article. The automatic wrapping should be better than the manual shit I did with the first articles whenre it only looks right when you have  the browser at the same resoulotion I did. I am also wanting to make photo grids and stuff something that can actually exist. The games section is something I have on my to do list and I want to make sure no links on the page 404.</p>

				<p id="articleText">The website is designed for desktop but I want to make sure it's usuable on moible. So if you are on moible I hope this website isn't terrible.</p>
