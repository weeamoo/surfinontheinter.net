I don't want to make an article about a trending topic if I have nothing to say that hasn't been said already. Right now I think the main focus will be Technology, Music, Life, and People who need to be send to the bottom of the oceam because of they operate their car like a luinetic. Yes their will be pictures of the cars and no I will not blur the liscense plates, it's your fault you paked brand new ford F250 in the handicap spot. I don't give a shit about Truck Month.
